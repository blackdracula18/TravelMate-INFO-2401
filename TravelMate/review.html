                        Hospitality at its best. You can not ask for more. If you go somewhere and you feel like that you are at your own home, that feeling is really amazing. Rooms are big and have historic touch to it. best restaurant in Jaisalmer having a view of golden fort.
                        they also arranged for our desert safari which was just awesome

                        The hotel is well located in the artist quarter. The rooms are spacious, clean and ours had a lovely view of jaisalmer fort. The host and staff are very helpful and attentive. I would happily recommend this place. My only suggestion would be to tidy up
                        the access pathway from the road to the hotel.

                        Look no further: this is the best, most beautiful location in Kyoto. For the past ten years of visiting Kyoto, I've always stayed in Gion, but I've never stayed in a more perfect place than Shiraume. Your night will include a view of the canal, white
                        herons, wooden baths, weeping willows, splendid old artwork, sweet service, and waking and dreaming in an authentic, former geisha house. Your time will be lovely, dreamy, and unforgettable.

                        Stayed for one night recently. Hotel was pretty empty due to Covid. The hotel did very good infection prevention steps, was quite impressed. Balcony view was really pretty. This side of the hotel has sunset views. Other reviews mentioned the train noise
                        which is VERY real and obtrusive. If we had the door to the balcony open the noise was terrible at times. If you shut to door and the second glass door, I am guessing installed just for noise, we slept fine. Light sleepers might
                        not do so well but I felt like the view and location made up for this.
